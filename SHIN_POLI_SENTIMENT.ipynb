    "## Introduction\n",
    "This dataset contains the classification of partisan bias, audience, and goals based on politicians' social media. Total rows total ~5000 and the objective is to clean, organize, manipulate data contents to derive meaningful conclusions based on hypotheses and analysis. For the final project, I have chosen sentiment analysis classifying political bias provided texts (in this case tweets). That is, to assign categories to the collection of data (political messaging) in order to aid in more accurate predictions and analysis. The idea of crowdsourcing draws on \"wisdom of the crowd\" arguments where I used the CrowdFlower/Kaggle database to access the data set to be used for this project, titled, \"Political Social Media Posts\" (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts/data).\n",
    "    \n",
    "I chose this topic in particular, not because I'm fascinated with politics, but for the harnessing power of social media and was curious to see how natural language processing (NLP) could computationally identify and categorize opinions expressed in the political messages to determine potential biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that a multivariate analysis problem of interest has been identified, the outline of the project shall continue as follows:\n",
    "1. Selecting Data Sources\n",
    "2. Preprocess data; Cleaning and transforming data, as needed\n",
    "3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "4. Perform Classification\n",

    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is important in the studies of news values, public opinion, negative campaigning or political polarization and the expansion of digital textual data and efficient progress in automated text analysis provides vast opportunities for innovated social sciences [research] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635074/). In general, a lack of tools and procedures for producing or collecting sentiment ratings of acceptable quality for large-scale data analyses currently limits the ease of use with this data mining technique. Typically with emphasis on large scale data, research projects can quickly overwhelm when faced with restrictions of time, money, limited trained coders. "

    "### Measuring Sentiment in Political Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the polarity of texts has a long tradition in social sciences. A prominent example is media negativity, capturing the over-selection of negative over positive news, the tonality of media stories, and the degree of conflict or confrontation in news. With sentiment analysis, a large dataset can be classified with variying polarity, valence or tone and classified as simply positive, negative, or neutral. For the purposes of this project, supervised learning automated approaches will be employed to \"learn\" the sentiment of political messages (Note - the instructions governing the dataset will be kept at a beginner due to time constraints and limits on the tools available to me). Latter analyses will introduce supervised learning techniques from course discussions and set up the basics of supervised machine learning in the realm of text analysis."

However, accuracy is not a reliable metric for the real performance of a classifier, because it will yield misleading results if the data set is unbalanced (that is, when the numbers of observations in different classes vary greatly). After numerous testing, the MNB classifier achieved accuracy of around ~ 0.33 and the SVM at ~ 0.318. As noted earlier, although the MNB achieves a certain level of accuracy, it struggles with over prediction and therefore those tendencies are reflected in the results. At the end of the day, if asked to choose between the two model predictors, the SVM remains quite accurate while still considering a wider range of message types. When fed larger textual data, the SVM would learn and continue to improve as sample size increases. Both models reflected positive results and could be a case-by-case basis on which model is better suited for different situations.

    "For this project, I was curious to see how well the NaiveBayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers performed for sentiment analysis, along with nltk (natural language toolkit). What I found was it did work rather well with any necessary text cleanup and minimizing text ambiguity. I think my understanding and interpretation of machine learning techniques improved while putting this together, but certainly completing similar would allow for a better grasp on the capabilities and limitations of implementing them in the future. All in all, text sentiment analysis proved to be a worthwhile challenge where I spent the majority of my time pre-processing the text data. \n",
